This repository implements a **multi-agent collective motion framework** inspired by **fish schools and boid models**, and extended with **probabilistic reinforcement learning** and **latent policy parameters** (θ) for drones simulation.

The codebase supports:
- Emergent collective motion without explicit goals (free roaming)
- Goal-directed collective navigation
- Replayable environments to animate or re-execute a learned parameter vector θ
- Reinforcement learning over low-dimensional behavior parameters

TODO: Adapt the behaviour to drone using the Hierarchical LMPC from https://github.com/fleurssauvages/Multi_RL_LMPC_for_Drone_Flock

## 🐠 Biological & Algorithmic Inspiration

This work is inspired by classical and modern studies of collective animal behavior, in particular:

- **Boids model** (Reynolds, 1987):
- Erik Martin Vetemaa Bachelor Thesis, https://github.com/vetemaa/fish-simulation and https://thesis.cs.ut.ee/a62fdbba-061c-475d-851e-8c49d61b09df

## 🧪 Main Scripts

### Free Roam — Emergent Collective Motion

Purely emergent behavior with no explicit goal, driven only by local interactions, similar to Erik Martin Vetemaa implementation, with modified behaviour.

### Goal Roam — Collective Navigation

Adds a global goal while preserving decentralized interactions.

### Environment & Replay
RL/env.py

Deterministic replay and visualization of learned θ.

### Reinforcement Learning
train_rl.py

Policy search over θ using probabilistic reinforcement learning using Power RL.
